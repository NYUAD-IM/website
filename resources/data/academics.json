Robots will be defined broadly, incorporating a wide range of machines both autonomous and remote-controlled. Students will be exposed to critical analysis regarding the historical and contemporary use of machines in art and theatrical performance. In parallel, students will also learn about electronics, programming, robotics and mechanical construction techniques. Over the course of the semester, students will iterate through multiple projects exploring how robots can convey meaning and emotion.

Instead of programming a computer to do a specific task, we program the computer to train and teach itself how to do any number of tasks. As artists, how can we harness the power of these algorithms and apply them towards creative endeavors? This class will explore that basic question. Through a combination of high level applied machine learning techniques, speculative design of artificial intelligence, and some basic understanding of how these algorithms work at a low level, students will explore this rich new field.
