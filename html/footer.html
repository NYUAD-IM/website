<div class="about-website" id="about">
	This website was made (almost) from scratch, as a <a href="https://github.com/nyuad-im/website">collaborative effort</a> between students, instructors and faculty of the IM program. Our desire to do-it-ourselves came from a belief that this is one of the ways to balance technology's tendency to alienate us from our creative activities. <br>

	<span style="text-align: left; float: left;">As Lewis Mumford put it, </span>
	<span class="lewis-quote">
		"...the greatest development of technics in the future will consist in using machines on a human scale, directly under human control, to fulfill with more exquisite adaptation, with a higher refinement of skill, the human needs that are to be served. [...] Much that is now in the realm of automatism and mass production will come back under directly personal control, not for abandoning the machine, but by using it to better purpose, not by quantifying, but by qualifying its further use."
